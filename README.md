# PDA Visualizer

## Overview
The PDA Visualizer is an interactive tool designed to provide a graphical representation and simulation of Pushdown Automata (PDA). It offers users an intuitive interface to construct, visualize, and simulate PDAs, facilitating educational understanding and analytical exploration of stack-based computation.

## Features
- Graphical interface for creating and editing PDAs.
- Visualization of PDA transitions and states.
- Simulation mode for testing input strings on constructed PDAs.
- Step-by-step execution of PDA simulations.
- Highlighting of stack changes during simulation.
- Export of PDAs and simulation results for further analysis.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd pda-visualizer`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage
1. Run the application: `npm start`
2. Access the application through the provided URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000) in your web browser.
3. Use the graphical interface to create or import PDAs.
4. Visualize and simulate PDAs by providing input strings.
5. Analyze simulation results and stack changes.
